# Logistic_Regression_Model
 A Binary Logistic regression model for predicting if a person would buy life insurnace based on his age.
 
 
** Model of Logistic Regression


    Sigmoid Function:-
        Takes input z and returns its sigmoid.
    Predict Function:-
        Takes input X and returns predicted y.
    Compute_loss Function:-
        Takes input 'y_true' and 'y_pred' and returns loss using above mentioned formula.
    Fit function:-
        fit function takes input X, y_true and optional arguments number_of_iterations, learning_rate.
        fit function works as follows
            initialization of weights and bias
            predicting output y_pred
            computing loss
            updating parameters
            atlast plots graph loss vs iterations
